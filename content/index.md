1. Welcome to Rocket.

    Hello! Thank you for joining us.
    
    The first day at any new job can be a confusing experience. You’ll meet lots of friendly people whose names you will most likely forget. You will be told about laws and benefits that will raise many questions and you may get lost looking for the toilet. The good news is that you will already have a schedule for that day, a nice desk, the hardware you chose and find everybody to be very helpful. It’s possible your first day at Rocket will be the most organized you will have in your time with us.
    
    Your second day and beyond is much harder to predict. We’ll cover more on the topic of how Rocket’s business model fosters a certain degree of chaos, but the immediate impact may be that you do not have a long term project when you join. You may be placed on short term projects for a little while until you feel like you truly “own” something. The upside is that this gives you a great opportunity to learn about different companies and meet new people.
    
    If you’re new to Germany, there will be lots of information coming your way, including how we help you settle into a new life in Berlin (including help with the language and more!).

1. What is Rocket’s business model?

    You may have heard Rocket’s reputation for being aggressive and ruthlessly efficient. Of course this is ridiculous and we laugh when we hear such stories. Ha ha ha. However, now you work at Rocket you should know this is not at all ridiculous. Stop laughing immediately.
    
    Our <del>aggressive and ruthless</del> strategy for growth is to frequently create new companies. A large number of these companies are created by a small group of people from our office in Berlin working in project teams. Over time, these project teams have learned from success and failure to help them understand how to build a company. Those companies then grow, develop a unique culture, hire their own team to replace the project team and design some fancy t-shirts. Like teenagers, they then move out of the house and into their own place on the road to true independence. We’ve been so successful at this that, according to Wikipedia, our companies employ over 30.000 people worldwide.
    
    Rocket has an unfair advantage when it comes to building startups. We are able to move faster than others without compromising quality by building a set of common mobile & web platforms that many of our companies use to get started. While these platforms provide useful tools and services, they are forked and modified to suit the particular needs of the company. After launch Rocket continues to support these companies with a variety of services such as further engineering work to help scale, assistance with recruitment and monitoring of live systems.
    
    While Rocket’s business model is fast and exciting, it does come with a degree of unpredictability -- we consider this a feature, not a bug. It is possible you will work on a project that will fail, followed by a project that needs to scale quickly. That transition may happen immediately or may be followed by a short period of work on internal projects to help make Rocket more efficient. Again, this is a feature, not a bug.

1. How we work.

    Rocket is ambitious and has high expectations of delivery and quality but we strive to foster a genuinely happy work environment. Maintaining such an environment is done by you & your colleagues but to help you along, here are some guidelines…

    * Be nice. While we’ve done a bunch of research into destroying all emotion, we have been unsuccessful… So far. The failure of that research means we need to be calm when things go wrong (which will happen), say “hello” in the elevator and do a robot dance when somebody does a good job.
    * Be curious. We may not fully understand how all decisions are made but we believe everybody is trying to do the right thing with the data they have. If you don’t understand something or disagree, you should feel comfortable asking.
    * Be trusting. Trusting the intent and competency of each other is cheaper than a process and more fun. The assumption of trust is a critical part of our hiring strategy and our success.
    * Be open to failure. When things don’t turn out as expected, celebrate it. We don’t make complex decisions in a silo so don’t expect to be blamed. Do expect to work out what we can learn and change to make ourselves better.
    * Be a good neighbor. The people in the next pod might be working on a launch or trying to deal with an unexpected burst of traffic. Be aware of their situation and think about whether they need to hear you on the phone to your mum.
    * Be available. We need close, cross-functional teams to work on difficult problems in unpredictable environments. This means working in the same place and, where possible, at the same time.
    * Be data-centric. Awesome and creative ideas are welcome and should be validated with qualitative or quantitative data. If our ideas aren’t as awesome as we think, then we modify or move on. Pride never beats data.

    Everybody should keep these points in mind and team leads should consistently use them as a basis for feedback and hiring. Team leads are not necessarily expected to be the smartest people in the room but they are expected to give their teams the environment and tools needed to be happy and successful.
