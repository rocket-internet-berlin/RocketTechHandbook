1. Welcome to Rocket.

    {% capture robot_message %}Guten Tag.{% endcapture %} 
    {% include robot.html %}

    Hello! Thank you for joining us.
    
    The first day at any new job can be a confusing experience. You’ll meet lots of friendly people whose names you will most likely forget. You will be told about laws and benefits that will raise many questions and you may get lost looking for the toilet. The good news is that you will already have a schedule for that day, a nice desk, the hardware you chose and find everybody to be very helpful. It’s possible your first day at Rocket will be the most organized you will have in your time with us.
    
    Your second day and beyond is much harder to predict. We’ll cover more on the topic of how Rocket’s business model fosters a certain degree of chaos, but the immediate impact may be that you do not have a long term project when you join. You may be placed on short term projects for a little while until you feel like you truly “own” something. The upside is that this gives you a great opportunity to learn about different companies and meet new people.
    
    If you’re new to Germany, there will be lots of information coming your way, including how we help you settle into a new life in Berlin (including help with the language and more!).

1. What is Rocket’s business model?

    You may have heard Rocket’s reputation for being aggressive and ruthlessly efficient. Of course this is ridiculous and we laugh when we hear such stories. Ha ha ha. However, now you work at Rocket you should know this is not at all ridiculous. Stop laughing immediately.
    
    Our <del>aggressive and ruthless</del> strategy for growth is to frequently create new companies. A large number of these companies are created by a small group of people from our office in Berlin working in project teams. Over time, these project teams have learned from success and failure to help them understand how to build a company. Those companies then grow, develop a unique culture, hire their own team to replace the project team and design some fancy t-shirts. Like teenagers, they then move out of the house and into their own place on the road to true independence. We’ve been so successful at this that, according to Wikipedia, our companies employ over 30.000 people worldwide.
    
    Rocket has an unfair advantage when it comes to building startups. We are able to move faster than others without compromising quality by building a set of common mobile & web platforms that many of our companies use to get started. These platforms provide useful tools and services but they are also forked and modified to suit the particular needs of the company. After launch Rocket continues to support these companies with a variety of services such as further engineering work to help scale, assistance with recruitment and monitoring of live systems.
    
    While Rocket’s business model is fast and exciting, it does come with a degree of unpredictability -- we consider this a feature, not a bug. It is possible you will work on a project that will fail, followed by a project that needs to scale quickly. That transition may happen immediately or may be followed by a short period of work on internal projects to help make Rocket more efficient. Again, this is a feature, not a bug.

1. How we work.

    {% capture robot_message %}Ich habe Gefühle.{% endcapture %} 
    {% include robot.html %}

    Rocket is ambitious and has high expectations of delivery and quality but we strive to foster a genuinely happy work environment. Maintaining such an environment is done by you & your colleagues but to help you along, here are some guidelines…
    
    * Be nice. We’ve spent 28,64€ on research to try and rid ourselves of all emotion. This was a disaster and losing over 28€ made us really angry. To compensate for that failure, we try to stay calm when things go wrong (and they will), say “hello” to each other in the elevator and do a little robot dance to celebrate success.
    * Be curious. We may not fully understand how all decisions are made but we believe everybody is trying to do the right thing with the data they have. If you don’t understand something or disagree, you should feel comfortable asking.
    * Be trusting. Trusting the intent and competency of each other is cheaper than a process and more fun. The assumption of trust is a critical part of our hiring strategy and our success.
    * Be open to failure. When things don’t turn out as expected, celebrate it. We don’t make complex decisions in isolation so don’t expect to be blamed. Do expect to work out what we can learn and change to make ourselves better.
    * Be a good neighbor. The people in the next pod might be working on a launch or trying to deal with an unexpected burst of traffic. Be aware of their situation and think about whether they need to hear you on the phone to your mum.
    * Be available. We need close, cross-functional teams to work on difficult problems in unpredictable environments. This means working in the same place and, where possible, at the same time.
    * Be data-centric. Awesome and creative ideas are welcome and should be validated with qualitative or quantitative data. If our ideas aren’t as awesome as we think, then we modify or move on. Pride never beats data.
    
    Everybody should keep these points in mind and team leads should consistently use them as a basis for feedback and hiring. Team leads are not necessarily expected to be the smartest people in the room but they are expected to give their teams the environment and tools needed to be happy and successful.

1. What you can expect from Rocket.

    There are some things you can expect from your Rocket, your manager and your colleagues:

    * You will only ever be promoted, paid or given feedback based on your experience, the quality of your work and the impact you have had.
    * You will work in the mode that best suits you and your team. Teams at Rocket use their judgement to choose the tools and methodologies they believe will yield the most success.
    * You will have as few rules and processes imposed on you as possible. Some processes are globally a good idea but those that cater to the lowest common denominator can damage autonomy.
    * You will not be asked by your manager to compromise quality. Rocket has built enough companies to know that deliberately cutting quality is always painful in the long run.
    * You may not know the project you will be working on in a few months. Change is part of Rocket’s business model which can be unpredictable and often fun.
    * You will be allowed to take reasonable risks. Well considered risks are at the heart of Rocket’s success so you will be provided with the latitude to experiment with something new to achieve great results.
    * You will be provided with opportunities to learn and grow. Rocket provides various career paths and you want to learn new, relevant skills. We will try to provide the time and resources to help you develop in the direction that best suits you.

    We thought about making a promise to “provide you with every variety of Kellogg’s Toppas breakfast cereal” but that list is actually too important for something so trivial and we cannot control the stock of the local supermarket. But know that we will try.

1. Learning & development.

    {% capture robot_message %}Ich möchte gern viel Lernen gut.{% endcapture %} 
    {% include robot.html %}

    Although you will learn and improve as a necessity of your role, we want you to seek out new skills to help you and Rocket stay effective. With that in mind, you can attend conferences and expense books and relevant courses. Propose what you would like to do with your manager, discuss whether it’s appropriate and affordable and they’ll help you get set up.

    To ensure the spread of knowledge across the many teams at Rocket, we have frequent Chapter meetings. A Chapter is a group of people interested in a particular topic such as Women in Tech, Android or Code Quality. They’re great places to learn something new, make important decisions and meet people you may not normally work with. If you’re interested in attending, check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nJCbCPLCsneS6fxc_LjvVS9oxJGIx8AFPD-ZuTYyBQU" target="_blank">Chapter Directory</a>. If you feel like there’s a missing Chapter then you are welcome to start your own.

    In addition to covering the cost of many learning resources and running Chapters, we also host frequent internal events called Happy Hours. These include a mixture of Rocket staff with an interesting topic and notable external guests. We try to encourage as many people as possible to talk and attend such events so if you do have a topic you’d like to present, be sure to get in touch with the organizer.

    Engineers can propose a project that will benefit Rocket or the wider community, such as a new tool or open source project. If you have such a project with a clear goal in mind, you can talk with your manager about it and they will arrange for approximately 20% of your time for 3 months to be set aside to achieve that goal.

    We only want engineers who really enjoy the science of leading & organizing teams to become managers at Rocket. Engineers who want a raise or a sense of career progression are traditionally pushed into a management role - we want to avoid this. We run engineering and management as parallel progressive career tracks so you can become an Engineering Director developing people or a Principle Engineer guiding technical strategy. We try to keep engineers engaged with a variety of new projects, providing time to learn, share skills and mentor other engineers.

1. Giving & receiving feedback.

    Every few months your team lead (who has been assigned a real name) will sit with you and discuss how things are going. This might sound official and intimidating but, in reality, it should be a boring procedure for the purposes of having something written down so we can track and plan your development. You will experience this at the end of your probationary period, 6 months after joining Rocket.
    
    In order to keep these biannual events feeling unexciting, discussions will be ongoing and multidirectional. If you’re doing a great job or can improve, you should expect to know about it when a pattern is detected and to help figure out what to do next. It is equally important that you let your team lead and colleagues know how they’re doing, too. Releasing information once a year based solely on your team lead’s observations seems ridiculous to us. If you leave a 6 month discussion in a state of utter shock or surprise, then we consider the feedback process to have failed.
    
    If you lead a team, it is your duty to know how everybody on your team is performing and feeling; whether they’re motivated, unmotivated, struggling or kicking ass. You’ll be given guidance by your own manager in how you’re expected to achieve such levels of omniscience. Keep in mind not just the business impact of the individual, but also how they impact the people they work with.

1. Social responsibility.

    We believe strongly that we are privileged to have a stable job, a safe work environment and a good income. We organize activities that try to improve the lives of people far less privileged than ourselves and would love for you to take part. You will see emails & posters when such opportunities occur, and, if you have a good idea of your own, we will help you organize and plan.

1. Where you work.

    {% capture robot_message %}Willkommen zuhause.{% endcapture %} 
    {% include robot.html %}

    For the sake of this, we’ll assume you work at Rocket HQ in Berlin where project teams and companies span multiple floors. A rough guide to a company’s maturity is how close it is to the front door of the building; closer to the door, more mature. Given that the location of project teams and companies is so fluid, here’s a more detailed and current guide to some useful locations of teams… 

    * The 5th floor houses many Rocket project teams, the In-House Sys Admin team and the Lounge. If somebody says “meet in the Lounge”, you’ll find it right across from the main elevators on this floor. You will visit the In-House team to collect your equipment on your first day but, for future reference, you can also email them.
    * The 4th floor contains project and company teams but also Reception (known as “Empfang” in German), Finance, Marketing, HR Management & Development and HR Finance. The two HR teams are particularly important early on as they will assist you with the paperwork you’ll need to receive pay and benefits.
    * The 2nd and 3rd floors are nothing to do with Rocket. Pretend they don’t exist.
    * The 1st floor contains many Rocket companies as well as HR Recruiting & Launch Management.
    * The Ground floor (also known as “EG” or “Erdgeschoss” in German) contains the lobby and, you know, more companies (including Rocket Labs). It also contains a portal to the outside world which we jokingly refer to as the “door” because it is a door.

    Each floor has a map somewhere near the main elevators or inside the door. This is useful when trying to find particular meeting rooms, for example. Don’t forget that you can always ask someone if you’re not sure!

    Around the office you’ll find lots of fruit, cereals, different types of drinks and kitchens. If you want something else, we are situated in the heart of Berlin so there are a lot of restaurants, bars and fast food. You should have no problem refueling.

    Keeping the office relatively clean is important. Everybody is expected to pick the trash up off the floor; from the executives to the people we pay to pick the trash up off the floor. When you leave meeting rooms, the next person in the room may be an interview candidate and we don’t want them associating a discarded banana skin with Rocket.

    In the event of an evacuation/intra-office apocalypse (“IOA”) you should panic your way down the stairs. Make yourself aware of your nearest fire exit and be sure to practice screaming and waving your arms. Do not use the elevators during an emergency as they may not be safe or could cease functioning, forcing the occupants into a desperate battle of wits to survive.

1. Pay.

    Once you have a German bank account and a tax ID (which are standards for you to get set up in this country), make sure HR Finance has it on file. You will then get paid around the beginning of each month. If you have any questions or concerns about your pay, feel free to visit HR Finance, who can be found just past reception on the 4th floor.

    We aim to pay a salary above the average for the Berlin tech market at each individual skill level. We actively monitor this to do what we can to make sure everything is fair. We want to avoid salary becoming a factor in your decision making. However, if you feel your salary doesn’t reasonably reflect the work you do, then you are encouraged to speak with your direct manager.

1. Data responsibilities

    {% capture robot_message %}Psst.{% endcapture %}
    {% include robot.html %}

    As a publicly listed company, we are obliged to avoid actual or apparent insider trading. This means not sharing any information you are exposed to for the purposes of buying or selling shares in Rocket or any Rocket companies. While intentionally sharing sensitive information is obviously unacceptable, you should also be aware not to do so unintentionally, too. Talking about imminent product launches to somebody from TechCrunch at a party is sub-optimal.

    The In-House team will provide you with advice on how to keep data safe but it’s worth emphasizing that your laptop’s storage should be encrypted, laptop screen locked behind a secure password when you’re away from your desk, a PIN should be set for your phone and you should use two-factor authentication where available. Be sure to inform the In-House team immediately if you misplace your office door pass, laptop or company phone.

    And remember: if you see police in the lobby, **QUICKLY SHRED EVERYTHING**... This is a joke. Please do not do this.   

1. A little bit of Rocket history (by Christian Hardenberg).
    
    My journey with Rocket officially started in 2012 when I joined as CTO. However I first met the Samwer brothers back in 1999, when they talked to a group of students at university about how they started Alando in Berlin and <a href="https://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/09/biztech/technology/22mcgr.html" target="_blank">sold it to eBay</a>. Already back then I was fascinated by their energy and drive to be successful. And clearly they were not ready to sit on the beach after earning their first millions with Alando. Next came Jamba (some Rocket Employees like Arnt and Julian can tell you stories about it), famously known in Germany for buying almost all free TV advertising slots available. I think it was a pretty amazing achievement to sell a company, whose main product was ringtones, for a whopping $273m. When was the last time you bought a ringtone?!
    
    After selling Jamba, the Samwers moved into the role of an investor for lots of different internet companies, some of them quite well known such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Zynga and MyVideo. But maybe just being an investor got a bit boring after a while. They wanted to be more hands-on again and to try and build more than one company at a time. This is how Rocket Internet was born in 2007. Rocket is a company that was setup to build many startups in parallel. 
    
    One huge early success of Rocket was building CityDeal, a company that was sold to Groupon less than 6 month for a 10% stake in Groupon. In the early years Rocket also founded eDarling, Wimdu, Home24 and Zalando.
    
    With Zalando we learned how e-commerce works. And it was only a logical step to apply these learnings to other markets like Brazil (Dafiti), Russia (Lamoda), India (Jabong) or South-East Asia (Zalora). We didn't stop with fashion e-commerce, we went into general merchandize (Lazada, Linio, Jumia), home & living (Westwing), food (Shopwings, Bonativo) and a lot of other areas.
    
    Over the years we have built a lot of different business models, from financial services (Lendico, Spotcap, Zencap, Payleven, Paymill) to marketplaces (Helpling, Foodpanda, Foodora, Kaymu, Lyke, Sparklist, Jovago), subscription services (Glossybox, HelloFresh), classifieds models (Lamudi, Carmudi, Vendomo, Everjobs) to mobile on-demand services (Easytaxi, Eatfirst, Zipjet).
    
    Our strategy going forward is to continue to explore new internet business models, launch new companies and build platform technology that allows our companies to be even more successful. If you are new to Rocket, I welcome you aboard for this ride.

1. Glossary.
    
    {% capture robot_message %}Entschuldigung?{% endcapture %} 
    {% include robot.html %}
    
    Alice & Bob -- A custom-built PHP framework many of our companies use. It has enabled us to get a head start when building ecommerce products.
    
    Anmelbest… Amenalistaty… Anmeldebestätigung… Whatever -- Registration paper. It provides an official recognition of your address and you will need a new one of these each time you change address in Germany. This will be required for opening a bank account and many other types of application form (e.g. phone contract)... And so the police know where to find you should you forget to pay for the U-Bahn.
    
    Bürgeramt -- The office you must visit in order to register your address and receive your Anmeldebestätigung. They also provide many other useful services, such as a German driving license, renewals of German passports, etc. An appointment can be made online but our relocation agency will help you with this (i.e. they will be your saviors, aka translators and will accompany you in person).
    
    Chapter -- A group of people interested in a similar topic who may work in different teams. They meet regularly to discuss and make decisions on their topic of interest.
    
    Happy Hour -- Social gathering that occurs every 2 weeks in the Lounge. It is often an interesting talk from a guest or Rocket employee, a movie night, Q&A session or general discussion. There are also free beverages (aka beer).
    
    Replicon -- A time tracking tool. Given many of us work on different projects, potentially for different companies, it is important to understand which companies our time should be “billed” against and where we’re putting our effort. It’s a good idea to update this at the end of each day and you must submit these at the end of each week to help us plan.
    
    Rockets -- Rocket employees are often referred to as “Rockets”. “Rock Stars”, “Rocketeers” or “Astronauts” are probably more appropriate but “Rockets” has already stuck. Deal with it.
    
    Seller Center/Rocket Labs -- Rocket Labs builds Seller Center, a white-label seller marketplace platform. The correct term for this team is indeed “Rocket Labs,” although people occasionally also refer to the team as “Seller Center”.
    
    SkyRocket -- A newer PHP framework that many of our younger companies are now founded on. Like Alice & Bob, SkyRocket is built at Rocket and provides a lot of important common functionality to get help us launch quickly.
    
    UMS -- The system used to send transactional emails.
